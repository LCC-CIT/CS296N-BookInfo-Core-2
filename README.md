This ASP.NET Core MVC web app demonstrates the use of a fake repository for unit testing a controller by means of Dependency Injection (DI).

Note: This app is just one app in the CS296nCourseMaterials repository.
To get the source code for this app you will need to clone or download the entire repository.

This demo was written for CS296N, Web Development 2:ASP.NET, at Lane Community College.
