# BookInfo ASP.NET Core MVC Web App
This web app demonstrates key concepts in the development of an ASP.NET Core MVC web app. Each branch represents a step in the development of this web app, see the [Master branch README](https://github.com/LCC-CIT/CS296N-BookInfo-Core-2/blob/master/README.md) for a description of each branch.

The current version targets .NET Core 2.2 and was written using Visual Studio 2017. It includes connection strings for SQLite on Mac OS, SQL Server Local DB on Windows, and MariaDB on Linux.

----

## Code added in this branch:
* Dockerfile
* Startup code for optional in-memory DB selected by an environment variable
* Connection string for MariaDB
* Other modifications to make the app containter friendly
* More details are in my [lecture notes on Docker](http://lcc-cit.github.io/CS296N-CourseMaterials/LectureNotes/CS296N-LN-WK09D1-Docker.html)
